x = 5
y = 10
print('x + y =', x+y) 
print('x - y =', x-y)
print('x * y =', x*y)
print('x / y =', x/y) 
print('x // y =', x//y) 
print('x % y =', x%y)
a = [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
print(a)
print(a[0])
print(a[5])
print(a)
print(len(a))
print(a.reverse())
a = {'January': 7, 'February': 8, 'March': 5, 'April': 5}
a['May'] = 6
print(a)
print(a['January'])
print("has letters" )
a = {'January': 7, 'February': 8, 'March': 5, 'April': 5}
a['May'] = 6
print(a)
print(a['January'])
print("has letters" )
